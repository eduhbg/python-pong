# :tennis: Pong Game with Python Turtle Library

This project had as a guide a tutorial of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc).

Hope you enjoy it! ðŸ‘½

## How it works:
A basic game that has two players, the player A is controlled by "A" and "S" keys, and player B is the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys.

When the game starts, the user needs to choose a game level that he wants to play (the level is directly related to the ball speed) and put a score number that will finish the game when a player gets that score.

## What I've learned:
How to use the [Turtle Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html), create levels, apply Python fundamentals and handling user input errors.
