# Pong Game with Python and Turtle Library

A game that has two players, the player A is controlled by "A" and "S" keys, and player B is the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys.

When the game starts, the user needs to choose a game level that he wants to play (the level is directly related to the ball speed) and put a score number that will finish the game when a player gets that score.
